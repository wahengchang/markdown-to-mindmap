1. Overview

These guidelines describe the interface and user experience for the web‑only “Markdown → MindMap” app, based on the reference UI (two‑pane editor + mind‑map preview). They ensure consistent layout, controls, and flows for designers, developers, and QA.

Disabled actions (e.g. when no nodes) are greyed out.

Node Interaction

Collapse/Expand: Click node circle or press Space when focused.

Select Node: Click text or use arrow keys in canvas.

Center Node: Auto‑center on select if sidebar filter active.

Search & Filter

Typing in filter input hides non‑matching nodes in real‑time.

Match highlights in contrasting color.

Export

Export buttons open a progress indicator.

Success toast appears on completion.
