Step 2: Basic Layout and Mindmap Implementation

## Objectives
- Set up the basic two-pane layout (similar to upload image)
- Implement mindmap tree visualization with mock data
- Verify mindmap rendering works correctly
- No interactivity required at this stage

## Basic Layout Implementation

1. HTML Structure
   - Create main container with two-pane layout
   - Left pane: Markdown editor area
   - Right pane: Mindmap visualization area
   - Add simple header/navigation bar
   - Add footer with basic info

2. CSS Implementation
   - Use Tailwind utility classes for layout
   - Set appropriate dimensions for editor and visualization panes
   - Implement responsive design for different screen sizes

## Mock Data Setup

1. Create Static Mock Data
   - Define sample markdown content for testing
   - Include various heading levels, lists, and formatting
   - Store sample data directly in HTML file

2. Markdown Structure Examples
   ```markdown
   # Main Topic
   ## Subtopic 1
   ### Detail A
   ### Detail B
   ## Subtopic 2
   ### Detail C
   #### Sub-detail
   ### Detail D
   ```

## Mindmap Tree Implementation

1. Basic Tree Structure
   - Define data structure for nodes and connections
   - Create tree building algorithm from parsed markdown
   - Handle basic hierarchical relationships

2. SVG Rendering
   - Create SVG container in right pane
   - Implement basic node rendering (circles/rectangles with text)
   - Add connecting lines between parent-child nodes
   - Apply default styling for nodes and connections

3. Layout Algorithm
   - Implement simple tree layout algorithm
   - Position nodes based on hierarchy level
   - Ensure no node overlap
   - Calculate appropriate spacing between branches

## Testing and Verification

1. Visual Testing
   - Verify mindmap renders correctly with mock data
   - Ensure all markdown hierarchy levels appear in tree
   - Check that tree layout is visually clear and readable
   - Verify text content displays properly in nodes

2. Structure Testing
   - Confirm tree structure matches markdown hierarchy
   - Verify parent-child relationships are correctly established
   - Test with different markdown structures

## Next Steps (for future phases)
- Implement real-time markdown parsing (Step 3)
- Add interactive features like zoom, pan, expand/collapse (Step 4)
- Integrate with user input instead of mock data
