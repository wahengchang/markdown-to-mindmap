# End-to-End (E2E) Tests

This folder is for all E2E (end-to-end) tests for the markdown-mindmap project.

## Guidelines
- Place all E2E test scripts and related files in this directory.
- Use a modern E2E testing framework (e.g., Playwright, Cypress, or Puppeteer).
- Organize tests by feature or user flow for clarity.
- Document how to run tests in this README or in the main project README.

## Example Structure
- `e2e/`
  - `README.md` (this file)
  - `home.spec.js` (example test file)
  - `login.spec.js` (example test file)
