1. Purpose
Enable users to instantly transform Markdown outlines into interactive mind maps, all within a single‑page web app—no installation, no CLI.

2. Scope
In Scope: Web REPL at markmap.js.org; client‑only JavaScript.

Out of Scope: CLI tools, IDE plugins, server‑side rendering.

3. Stakeholders
Product: Defines goals & prioritization

Design: UI/UX, accessibility

Engineering: Frontend framework, performance

QA: Cross‑browser, accessibility testing

Marketing: User acquisition, docs

4. Objectives & Success Metrics
Live Preview: ≤ 200 ms render for 500 nodes

Adoption: 1,000 DAU within first quarter

Performance: First meaningful paint < 1 s

Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

5. User Personas
Claire, Technical Writer

Needs quick visualization of document structure.

Devon, Educator

Embeds mind maps in lecture notes.

Morgan, Knowledge Manager

Shares interactive maps in knowledge base.

6. Use Cases
ID	User Story
UC1	As Claire, I paste Markdown and immediately see the mind map.
UC2	As Devon, I control fold states via inline magic comments.
UC3	As Morgan, I customize colors/spacing in frontmatter once and share a link.
UC4	As Claire, I export the map as PNG to include in a slide deck.

7. Functional Requirements
FR1: Parse Markdown (headings, lists, code, math) 
markmap.js.org

FR2: Render interactive SVG with expand/collapse, zoom, pan 
markmap.js.org

FR3: Read JSON options from frontmatter (markmap key) for theming, spacing, animation 
markmap.js.org

FR4: Recognize magic comments (fold, foldAll) for initial node state 
markmap.js.org

FR5: Export current view to PNG and SVG files

8. Non‑Functional Requirements
NFR1: Bundle size ≤ 150 KB (gzipped)

NFR2: Render time ≤ 200 ms for 500 nodes on a mid‑range laptop

NFR3: Works offline via service‑worker caching

NFR4: Keyboard‑navigable; ARIA labels on all controls

9. UI/UX Requirements
Split view: Markdown editor on the left, mind map on the right

Collapsible settings panel for JSON options

Top toolbar with buttons:

Export (PNG, SVG)

Reset View

Copy Embed Code

Syntax highlighting in editor (Monaco or CodeMirror)

Dark/light mode toggle

10. Analytics & Monitoring
Opt‑in performance telemetry: render times, node counts

Error logging (client‑side) with user consent

11. Security & Privacy
Sanitize any HTML embedded in Markdown

No data leaves the client by default

User prompt for telemetry opt‑in

12. Accessibility & Internationalization
Full RTL language support

ARIA labels and roles on nodes and buttons

UI copy stored in a JSON file for easy localization

13. Success Criteria
Achieve ≤ 200 ms render time at 95th percentile

80% of new users activate at least one export within first session

WCAG 2.1 AA score ≥ 90 from automated audit
